Our project is using smart IoT route-detection technology to improve commute safety by informing car drivers about the presence of cyclists and pedestrians. The same data can also help with direction prediction and with informing city traffic management systems; for example, about when to change traffic lights when vehicles are queing.

Our algorithms are also able to distinguish with some reasonable accuracy between people and bikes going in front of the ultrasonic distance sensor.
